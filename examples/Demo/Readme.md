# SPARCED model demo

This Demo folder containes pre-created and pre-compiled SPARCED model files. Users can create the model files using "createModel" notebook and can run the model using "runModel" notebook.
The pre-simulated data are also given (GrowthStim_S_demo.txt and GrowthStim_G_demo.txt) and users can compare their simulations to these provided files.

## createModel notebook:

- This notebook is already run and the model instance (AMICI required) files are saved in the `SPARCED` subfolder. Users can run the notebook again, with a new model file name to compare to our model provided here.

## runModel notebook:

- The stimulation conditions are reported below, where users can run the notebook and compare to existing results/figures.

### Simulation conditions:
- Stimulate with all ligands
- 12 hours of simulation
- Deterministic simulation mode (flagD=1)


## System properties

- Windows desktop computer (Windows 10 Education, Intel Core i5-3470 CPU @ 3.20GHz, 8.00GB RAM, 64-bit operating system)
- Model creation time: ~2 min
- Model compilation time: ~20min
- Model simulation time <1min
