# The Legacy SPARCED Model

This model is the original SPARCED 1.3.0 version. It is based on the same input
data files, and was compiled using the dedicated Jupyter Notebook located in
the Demo folder of the original
[Birtwistle lab's GitHub repository](https://github.com/birtwistlelab/SPARCED).

Hence, those files were not generated using the code located in this
repository.

At first, those files were renamed to ensure full compatibility with version
2.0.0. Compatibility was maintained as long as the input files format was
the same, which is no longer the case.

Indeed, SPARCED has evolved to remove support of the stoichiometric matrix.
The coefficients are now included in the Ratelaws file, which is now written
in a different format than the original one.

For all those reasons, the legacy SPARCED model can no more be run using the
current pipeline. You may still find some support by either checking the
original repository, or simply switch to a version of this repository prior to
December 2024.

Feel free to contact the
[Birtwistle Lab](https://www.birtwistlelab.com/contact) or the
[Erdem Lab](https://www.umu.se/en/research/groups/cemal-erdem-lab/) to require
for some assistance or if you have any further questions.
We will be more than happy to help you!
