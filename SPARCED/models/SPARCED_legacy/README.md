# SPARCED legacy

This model is the version 1.3.0 of SPARCED.

Data consists of the original, unaltered input files.

The model was generated from the Jupyter notebook located in the Demo folder of
the version 1.3.0 of the main branch of the original SPARCED repository.

Prefixes were manually added to the files and folder names to allow
compatibility with current pipeline.

The model name is "SPARCED".
